App that makes you focus. Based on a blank custom launcher by code.tutsplus.
This is an app that is intended to block you from seeing SMS messages and other notifications for a certain amount of time. It sets as your home screen.

For 25 minutes, you are unable to see any notifications. If you attempt to move to your recent apps, the program will lock your phone and go back to the home screen. If you attempt to look at your notifications, it does the same thing. You can disable it of course if you wish.

After the timer ends, you will have 3 minutes to check your messages and use other apps. The cycle repeats. The fourth cycle features a longer break.

The project is not perfect, as we were limited by the security features of android (which for instance prevent you from disabling the navigation bar, something we wanted to do).
Another issue: preventing you from visiting your recent apps does not always work.

If while the study timer is counting down, notifications are muted. If you recieve an SMS, the phone will lock to prevent you from seeing a popup notificaiton. If you recieve a phone call, the ringer will unmute, but mute once you hang up or finish the call.

The timer is set to 1 minute of studying and a 1:40 minute break for demonstration purposes.
